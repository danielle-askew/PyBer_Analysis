# PyBer_Analysis
Looking at ride share data to determine and help improve access to ride share services and affordability in under served areas.

## Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type.
The PyBer Summary Data let's us compare PyBer's ridesharing services. 
We have broken the data down by city type into three types of cities:
* Rural
* Surburban
* Urban

The data is sampled from a 5 month period between January 2019 and May 2019.

We can see right away that there is a bigger demmand for ride sharing services in Urban cities compared to the Suburban and Rural ones.

As in the past example, when we break the service down by driver's in each city type the data follows the same pattern. Urban cities employ a larger volume of  drivers than Suburban or Rural cities. 
Urban cities have almost 5 times the amount of drivers than the suburban cities and 31 times more than the amount in Rural cities. Meanwhile, Suburban cities have a little more than 6 times the amount of drivers than rural cities.

The total fares by city type show a huge price increase when outside of the Urban cities. This can be attributed to the great usage of PyBer in the Urban cities. PyBer made a total of nearly $40,000 in the Urban cities, compared to $19,000 in the Suburban cities and $4,000 in the rural ones.

When we break it down in terms of cost to the rider per ride (refrencing our data summary), Rural cities pay on average of about $10 more for PyBer ride sharing services than the riders in Urban cities. Rural cities show an average of $34.62 fare per ride whereas the average fare per ride is $24.53 in urban cities. The average in Suburban cities is $30.97. The average fare per ride in rural areas may hurt the riders pocket book but may help the driver. The average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities and burban cities' average fare per driver is about $40.

## Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides

## Summary
Rural Pyber users on average should expect to pay more for rides. Cities by nature have higher populations, leading to a bigger driver pool and allowing Pyber users to get lower fares.The more urban areas were by far the biggest generators of fares for Pyber.
Based on the analysis my business recommendations to Pyber are: Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
